As we both were walking in the front direction, we saw a man through the fence of the park (the fence has huge gaps in it so the guy was easily visible) unzip his pants and LITERALLY PEE IN FRONT OF US, his penis was visible. The guy was giving us an eerie look and literally staring at us WHILE peeing, as if he's about to devour us. This truly was a shocking experience for us both, Delhi truly is unsafe for women.  \n",

       "India is home to many stray animals (By stray I mean animals who have never been adopted ever before ) and this cat is one of them. While it is true that one cannot help each and every animal in need but even if they could do little it would be much.(My english can be a bit broken so bear with me )\\n\\n![img](7r2alfpgebk21)\\n\\n![img](84xcf4gjebk21)\\n\\n![img](c1n7yq31ebk21)\\n\\nSo here is a cat who used to eat daily from dustbins and other place wherever she could find food , she used to drop the dustbin of my home at night and used to search for food and eat whatever she gets . But , one day I saw the cat and offered her some food she ate that fast and so I gave her some more. Since that day she has started showing up daily at my door  so I bought a small packet of dry cat food from a local pet store but my dilemma is that I am a student and it wont be possible for me to buy cat food everytime and for the same reason I cannot adopt her. Also I didn't find any cat shelters in my city. This cat waits daily before I come home from my coaching and meows many time when she sees me , also after I give her the food then also she meows for an extended period of time which really makes my heart melt and I feel really sad for this cat. From the looks of it she is not injured in any way. But since I won't be able to support this cat everytime I am not sure what should I do , should I stop feeding this cat I am not sure. But I am really worried for this cat.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI thought maybe I should raise some dnuf (read is reverse order , my previous post was removed for usnig fund word) for cat but I don't know how to do that , also I am not sure if anyone would really be interested in donating.\\n\\n![video](g4c74s0ocbk21)\\n\\n![video](g7t3d72ocbk21)\\n\\nPlease suggest something what should I do.\\n\\nYou can message me for suggestions.         1\n",
