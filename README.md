# Reddit-Flair-Detection

This repository deals with Reddit flair detections. Reddit is a popular social media platform where user can upload posts in various sub-reddits. Sub-reddit is a forum dedicated to a specific topic. Reddit flairs are tags given to each Reddit post and detecting the tag from the title/content of the post is the aim of the project. For this purpose, the pushshift API has been used to fetch the Reddit posts, at max. 100 per request. I have fetched top 100 daily posts (based on upvotes) from the sub-reddit r/india, a sub-reddit dedicated to topics related to India for the last six years.
